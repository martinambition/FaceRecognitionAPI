# In-Store Analytics

Click-throughs, bounce rates, segmentation and conversion funnels are common and essential metrics for any online store. Brands which do not employ these to enhance the experience will miss out on targeted content, display optimization and personalized recommendations which account for over 20% of an online-stores revenue.

We take the latest artificial intelligence breakthroughs in the field of vision-based Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to change the game. AI algorithms detect your visitors demographics - such as age, gender, which can be leveraged for marketing compaign segmentations. Capturing the emotional state of your visitor is a new way to measure customer satisfaction in a digital ear. 

Learn from consumer behavior to improve conversion rates and transaction size. Measure the entire-funnel from walk-by through to completing a sale. Automatically exclude store staff from traffic counting and other KPI metrics. Compare your performance against your industry on a local, regional or national level.


With In-Store Analytics, B1 Retailers can leverage the power of digital footprints to apply the same tools as their online counterparts.
